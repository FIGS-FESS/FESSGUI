This test suite is used to test serial communications without hardware.

Requirements:
1.  *nix OS
2.  Bash Shell
3.  Python 2.7.12 or equivalent
4.  pyserial 2.7 or equivalent
5.  SOCAT 1.7.3.1-1 or equivalent

First open socat in one terminal using:
socat -d -d pty,raw,echo=0 pty,raw,echo=0

Make a note of the ports that are echoed back
these should be similar to the following:
Port 0: /dev/pts/0
Port 1: /dev/pts/1

Set the serial interface to <Your Port 0> in the QT Interface.
Run the following command from the python-test-suite dir in another terminal:

python testsuite.py <Your Port 1>

Observe the Interface and logs to ensure the Interface is behaving correctly.

If the interface or python is having problems accessing the serial device
kill socat with ctlr+c and restart it.
